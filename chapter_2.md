## 2.0 Literature Review

The novel coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan china in December
2019 and by February 2020 had already spread all over the world due
to the interconnectedness of the twenty first century. The WHO declared
it as a pandemic on (date) and since this virus was spread through human
contact the WHO advised all world governments to implement social distancing
policies inorder to mitigate the spread of the virus.

Learning institutions were identified as major hotspot due to the fact that
learners are from diverse backgrounds and interact a lot. Thus as a mitigation
measure learning instituions were closed indefinitely all around the world. This

a lot of questions on when schools would reopen and whether the dates of
the national examinations would be postponed.

country . This was majorly done through television and radio programmes 
approved by KICD and for some through the use of e-learning portals. Although

educational content due to the diverse economic challenges in the country.

The government still insisted that the national examinations would still be
carried out as scheduled until jun 17th.

exams which usually take place during the month of December and November are
of great importance to learners in the country and are of great interest to
the whole of the country.

In order to determine the impact of the coronavirus on the education calendar
we had to ask parents what part of the calendar they were really concerned about
 - how long the virus will last
