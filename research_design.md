## academic calendar
In order to gain insight on how the school academic calendar will be affected ,
we have identified our target population as senior officials in the ministry of
education and teacher union organisations , that is KNUT and KUPPET. We have choosen
them as our target population as they are major stakeholders in the education 
sector and their decisions affect how the school academic calendar will be shaped.

We will carry out in person interviews and fall back to  over the phone interviews where
we find it incovenient to hold in person interviews and save on costs.We will conduct
purposive sampling whereby we will interview  the permanent secretary ,
KNUT secretary and KUPPEt secretary. Our rationale for choosing this the purposive
sampling technique is that these individuals play a major role in deciding how
the school academic calendar will turn out to be and thus have forehand knowledge
of how the calendar will be affected if at all.

The interview questions will be open ended questions which will be, whether they think the school calendar
will be greatly affected , how will the school calendar be affected in the short
and long run . In addition, how will this distrubtion affect the coverage of the
curriculum and issuance of the national examinations.We choose open ended questions
so....

How will this data be collected and analysed ?


//whether it will increase
In order to determine the level of school dropout rate whereby our target 
population is total primary and secondary school population in the territory
of Kenya we will perform a multi-stage clustering sampling. (should we include
a reason why we chose this method of sampling?). We will first cluster counties
in terms of their economic output grouping them into 5 . From those clusters in
each we will randomly choose(ongezea mambo ya random numbers) 3 counties. In each
of those three counties we will list their subcounties in alphabetically order and
randomly choose 3 subcounties. Furthermore , in each of these subcounties we will
list in alphabetical order both primary and secondary schools and randomly select
5 from each list.

To collect data , we will conduct over the phone interviews with the heads of
these schools and ask them the following questions. What were the number of their
student population before schools were closed and what were the number of their
student population a month after the schools we reopened.
//how will we collect that data and analysis methods that we will use
