## academic calendar
In order to gain insight on how the school academic calendar will be affected ,
we have identified our target population as senior officials in the ministry of
education and teacher union organisations , that is KNUT and KUPPET. We have choosen
them as our target population as they are major stakeholders in the education 
sector and their decisions affect how the school academic calendar will be shaped.

We will carry out in person interviews and fall back to  over the phone interviews where
we find it incovenient to hold in person interviews and save on costs.We will conduct
purposive sampling whereby we will interview  the permanent secretary ,
KNUT secretary and KUPPEt secretary. Our rationale for choosing this the purposive
sampling technique is that these individuals play a major role in deciding how
the school academic calendar will turn out to be and thus have forehand knowledge
of how the calendar will be affected if at all.

The interview questions will be open ended questions which will be, whether they think the school calendar
will be greatly affected , how will the school calendar be affected in the short
and long run . In addition, how will this distrubtion affect the coverage of the
curriculum and issuance of the national examinations.We choose open ended questions
so....

How will this data be collected and analysed ?
We will record these interview using a digital audio recorder and the audio
will be backed up in our cloud storage platform for redudancy. The digital audio
recordings will enable us to not only revisit the interviews to gain more insight
but its form enables us to share the copy within ourselves with ease. We will
use the Trint trancription software to perform intelligent verbatim transcription
inorder to collect and prepare our data for analysis. For data analysis we plan
to use thematic analysis as our data is qualitative in nature and this technique
enables us to closely examine the data to identify common patterns of meaning that
come out repeatedly.



//whether it will increase
In order to determine the level of school dropout rate whereby our target 
population is the total primary and secondary school student population in the territory
of Kenya we will perform multi-stage clustering sampling.We chose to use
this method as our population is widely geographically dispersed and this
method is the only one that could be both time and cost effective.
We will first cluster counties in terms of their economic output grouping them into 5 . From those clusters,in
each we will randomly choose 3 counties. In each
of those three counties we will list their subcounties in alphabetically order and
randomly choose 3 subcounties. Furthermore , in each of these subcounties we will
list in alphabetical order both primary and secondary schools and randomly select
5 from each list.

To collect data , we will conduct over the phone interviews with the heads of
these schools and ask them  close ended questions.We chose to conduct our
interviews over the phone as it will be cost effective because our samples
are widely geographically dispersed and the phone  and network penetration rate
is high in the territory of Kenya.The following questions will be asked, what were the number of their
student population before schools were closed and what were the number of their
student population a month after the schools we reopened.These two questions will
enable us to compute the dropout level at each school which we consider to be
the difference between the previous student population and the student population
after schools are reopened. In addition, we chose to conduct our survey roughly one month
after the schools are reopened since at that time we estimate that the student population
will have settled.

We plan to collect this data in an excel sheet and use the python programming
language to do our data analysis.
//how will we collect that data and analysis methods that we will use

To collect data on the participation level of students and teachers in distance
learning activities during the school closure period , we will ask the participants
both close ended and open ended questions. We will produce a questionaiire which
we will print them and use the postal service to reach the targetted schools.

The questions that the students will answer will include, whether they participated
in any form of learning during the lockdown period, how many days did they participate,
what kind of learning did they participate in whether it was online, self paced or using
other media devices. Moreover, whether there school offered any type of distance 
learning and if so what type was it. We also ask them what challenges they faced
will participating in distance learning. 

We will analyse this data using the python programming language data analysis tools
