In order to gain insight on how the school academic calendar will be affected
we will carry out in person interviews or over the phone interviews with the
permanent secretary , KNUT secretary and KUPPEt secretary.The interview questions
will be open ended questions which will be, whether they think the school calendar

population is total primary and secondary school population in the territory

of those three counties we will list their subcounties in alphabetically order and
randomly choose 3 subcounties. Furthermore , in each of these subcounties we will
list in alphabetical order both primary and secondary schools and randomly select
5 from each list.

To collect data , we will conduct over the phone interviews with the heads of
these schools and ask them the following questions. What were the number of their
student population before schools were closed and what were the number of their
student population a month after the schools we reopened.
