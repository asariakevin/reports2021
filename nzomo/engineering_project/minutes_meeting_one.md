## Agenda

1. Preliminaries
2. Member Projects discussion
3. A.O.B


### Min. 1/20 Preliminaries

The meeting  was brought to order by the chairman at 3pm.

### Min. 2/20 Members Projects Discussion

Kibet Emmanuel began the session by informing us that he had come up with two
projects. His first project was a sun tracking solar panel that would increase
power generation by 30% while the second was a device to count the number of
coils used while performing motor rewinding which will ensure the process is
more accurate.

Modesta then presented her project by title 'temperature control by relay system'
that she assured us would a control system that maintains liquids at specified
temperature with a tolerance of 2 degrees celcius.

Kibor followed with a few project ideas, namely a project to relay a warning if
a meter is being tampered with, a dual axis solar tracker system , a micro inverter
and a low power relay driver. He agreed that he would show Kibet Emmanuel what 
his plans were on the dual axis solar tracker since they had the same idea.

Kevin asaria then shared two project ideas , the first being an automation system
of the transfer switch that would enable the dynamic control of what lines to be on 
when the back up generator kicked in. The second idea was an energy monitoring
system that would allow the tracking of the battery level during charging and
discharging.

Jude Nyoike added that he will be working on a system to protect equipment in case
of over voltage or under voltage

Kelvin Wachira concluded by giving us a brief on his wireless system that would
relay messages incase energy meters are being tampered with.

### A.O.B

The members agreed to share materials that they found useful during their research
and support each other through the journey.

### Min 3/20 : Adjournment

The members agreed to have their abstracts written up by Friday so as to ensure
they will be forwarded on time.
