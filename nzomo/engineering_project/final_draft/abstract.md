# Title: Prioritizable Dynamic Distribution Panel For BackUp Power Systems

Back up generators usually do not generate enough power to power up all the 
appliances in a house. This results in the home owner having to manually turn off
specific circuit breakers from the distribution panel. When the home owner wants to turn on
a specific circuit which requires a higher power input , they have to decide 
which  circuit breaker(s) to turn off inorder to ensure that the  needed circuit gets enough
power. This can be cumbersome and inconvenient when you want to switch off or on
different circuits from time to time as it is a manual process which requires a lot of movement of the home owner
. This project aims to automate this process so as to make it convenient and dynamic such that it
can be done with the push of a button either through a digital panel of pushbuttons located at a convenient location,
remote control.In addition, one can set the prioritisation of different circuits
so as to ensure that the most critical equipment is given high priority when the system is left in auto mode.
This is achieved through the use of a microcontroller to control relays. The inputs to the
microcontroller are  pushbuttons , RF receiver and a bluetooth receiver , all used
to enable the digital switching on of circuits. The device can also display the
current amount of power being consumed by house hold appliances.This is achieved
by use of a current transformer to measured current supplied to the house
