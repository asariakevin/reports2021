## 1.1 Background

Power outages are a frequent occurrence in developing countries and usually
back up systems are set up for such situations. However most people cannot 
afford large capacity back up systems thus their energy demand is not fully met
by their systems. This necessites them to manually trip circuit breakers of
circuits that are not of high priority so as to save power for the highest priority
circuits. This manual process is cumbersome especially when one needs to switch
between circuit inorder to utilise and electrical appliance. 

Furthmore, if the back up power system kicks in when individuals are not around
to manually turn off unnecessary circuits, losses maybe incurred as back up energy
is drained by those devices.
## 1.2 Problem Statement

The effective utilisation of back up power is of paramount importance as it limited
and as you never know how long it will take for power to return to the mains. This
means that the back up power level should be closely monitored and circuits kept
on only according to their level of personal priority and the current energy level.
When a certain energy level is reached only the highest priority circuit should 
be left on to ensure that no disruption to that system occurs.

Current distribution boards although some are smart lack this feature of setting
priorities to given circuits with respect to the back up energy level. Such 
a distribution board would greatly help increase the time that critical electrical
machines and devices operate reducing losses in the process

## 1.3 Aims And Objectives Of Study

The main aim of this project is to come up with a prioritizable smart distribution
board that will ensure that each circuit has a priority number which ensures that
during back up power occasions the highest priority circuit will automatically
last the longest. In addition, one can switch on and off given circuits remotelt
at their own convenience getting rid of the laborious manual process.

## 1.4 Scope Of Study

This project will utilise as a back up power system a battery charged using solar
power. Only residential building wiring will be used but the concepts can applied
to other various wirings.
