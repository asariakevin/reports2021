## 3.0 Research Methodology

## 3.1 Introduction

Inorder to determine what kind of impact the coronavirus would have on the
education calendar, we came up with questionaires which we gave to parents
and students . These questionaires had mostly questions concerning what
the receipts viewed as the most affected area of the education calendar.

We also reviewed reports by KNUT which it submitted to the emergency response
committee. Moreover , we looked into the ministry of education report and 
followed through various news platforms what the cabinet secretary had to 
say about the effects of covid19 on the education calendar.

## 3.2 Research Design

We began by doing a survey of questions to 4 parents , 10 primary and secondary
school learners and 15 university students. The questions included , what did
they see as the most affected part of the education calendar, if they were 
engaging in distance learning, if they wanted the national examinations to be
postponed , if they were willing to go back to learning in schools ,

We also reviewed the report by knut and MoE to get a view of the current situation and their suggestions. In addition, we reviewed the knut secretary general 
columns in the newspaper and television interviews of the cabinet secretary in
charge of education prof Magoha

## 4.0 Data analysis and Interpretation

On the question of what they saw as the most affected part of the education 
calendar ,  30 said they were concerned about national exams , 9 about 
class repetitiond and one was concerned about the cancellation of 
extracurricula activities such as drama and music festivals

On the question of whether they were engaging in distance learning 2/10 of
the parents said yes , 3/10 of the primary school students said yes , 4/10
of the secondary and 4/10 of the university students

When it came to the postponement of the national examination , 38/40 of the
respondents said they wanted the national examinations to be postponed to next
year, 2021, while 2/40 insisted that they did not want the examinations postponed

On whether they were willing to go back to school if the government opened up
schools 5/40 said they would go to school in the first week of schools opening,
35/40 said they would go to school after the first week of opening

From the report that KNUT submitted to the emergency response committee, they
were very clear that they wanted the national examinations to be postponed to
next year. The cabinet secretary on the other hand upto until June 17th 2020
was adamant that the national examinations would take place as planned. In
addition , the ministry at first planned for schools to reopen the second term
as planned but later on closed the schools indefinitely as the cases continued 
to rise. However, on June 6th HE president Uhuru Kenyatta, said that schools
would reopen in september as the health experts had predicted that by then our
curve of infections would have gone down.

From the data we gathered, it appears that concerning the school calendar a 
majority of Kenyans are concerned about the national examination and want it 
postponed as it plays a
very crucial role on the life of all Kenyans. This is because it determines what
kind of opportunities and future any Kenyan child will have. Although the 
disruption of learning activities for almost a term or semester , a majority of
the respondents were not really concerned by them repeating a class as it affected
all Kenyan learners and the world as a whole.

On matters distance learning, it seems that a majority of learners stopped learning
as soon as schools were closed. Although KICD has produced a lot of educational
content for both primary and secondary schools it seems that many Kenyans are
not able to access them, due to lack of knowledge of where to find the content
or lack of the technology to enable them access the content. In addition , most
households do not provide a favourable environment for learning.

## Discussion , Conclusions and Recommendations

The constitution of Kenya , 2010 states that it is a right for every Kenyan 
child to access free and basic education , it also says that every Kenyan has
a basic right to life.
