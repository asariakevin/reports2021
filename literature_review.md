##Introduction

For centuries, studies have shown that education is an important
aspect of lif as it equips one with knowledge , skills and attitude
to use in life. Improvements in technology has led to the adoption
of online learning where students are not always physically present
at a school. THus has got both advantages and disadvantages including
flexibility being the main advantage. For disadvantages , less
number of courses are available, poor quality of education and attitudes.

The covid19 pandemic is unique and new.Nothing like it has been delt with in the past. Measures have been put in place to curb the spread
among people such as lockdown, measures , wearing of face masks, washing of
hands with soap and water or using alcohol based sanitizer, closing
of schools, restrictions of travel among others. Kenya's government
has committed subsidies for education but yet not every shild gets
to graduate from school. About 30 per cent of the students who
enrol for school in class one in Kenya, fail to sit for the KCPE,
signifying the high rate of dropout.

##School dropout
The global coronavirus pandemic and the more concentrated ebola virus
outbreak, which killed more than 11,000 people are very different
situations but there are similarities in the way in which education
is affected.(Ewan Watt, Online Editor, Theirworld, 2 april 2020)

In both outbreaks, education was hit quickly and hard. Ebola forced
5 million childrean out of school for up to nine months in the West
African nations. This is almost to close to the more than nine months
that schools in Kenya have been closed. Thus our fears that many
students may fail to return to class as was the result in ebola
virus case is justified. With the ebola virus, many students got
pregnant, ebded up in child labour and parents were not able to
send their children back to school due to poverty caused by the ebola
crisis.

## Distance Learning

The disruption on the education system caused by covid 19 has imposed
a massive shift to online and home learning which is a new phenomena
for most kenyans

UNESCO recommended the use of distance and home learning programmes
supported by open educational applications and platforms that schools
and teachers could use to reach learners inorder to limit the
disruption of education.

The online platforms include television, mobile phones, radio and
emails.However, criticism has been encountered for this new way of
learning as it does not apply to every student in Kenya especially
the ones being of upcountry sides which apparently forms the majority
of the population of the learning students. Retrieved from the article

## conclusion

The government of Kenya has put in place measures to curb school dropout.
Schools have been warned by the ministry of education from sending
students home for school fees especially the ones that can't afford.
The ones that can pay their school fees are urged to do so as to help
maintain and run th schools. Mentoring programmes have been set in
schools to help mentor students from the psychological trauma that
might have been caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Various organisations are developing sponsoring programmes for students in schools.
The basic requirement - face mask, is being provided by the government
to schools so that every child could possess them to go back to school
with the needed equipment which complies with the measures the 
government has put in place to reduce the spread of covid19 .Retrieved
